# 09c milestones (set 2026-10-10, Integration)

Rule: a milestone closes when its exit criteria are met, and then it is FROZEN. Closed work is only reopened when
the regression suite (below) flags it. Nobody revisits a closed item for "maybe a bit more".

Order: M1 -> M2 -> M3 run now (M1 is top priority for timed slots); M4 runs on the GPU in gaps throughout;
M5+ start when M1 closes.

## Measurement standard (applies to every milestone)
- Comparisons (A/B): seeded lockstep match (tools/fidelity/lockstep-ab.ps1), 1 rep per arm once its A/A noise
  floor is known; SIMHASH and draw / chars parity must match across arms, else the row is UNKNOWN.
- Verdicts (does a map meet the target?): free-running 64p real play + overview, 2 reps, quiet machine,
  contamination watchdog on. Never conclude from a single free-running rep.
- Regression suite: after every merge batch that touches rendering, sim or UI, one lockstep pass on all 8 maps
  vs the last baseline. A row worse by > 0.15 ms p90 blocks the next playtest build until explained or reverted.

## M1 - 300 fps everywhere (64p)
Exit: all 8 TDM maps, 64 players, p90 <= 3.33 ms in BOTH verdict reps, at 4K and 1080, overview and real play.
Image byte-identical (or verified state-identical) for every change.
Status: Debris, Streets, Berth, Complex, Seed, Molten MET; Gorge on the line (3.33-3.44); Rust 0.1-0.3 over.
Bounded work list (nothing else is added without Integration):
1. HUD: settle the verifier mismatch (OFF/OFF run), then HUD batching patch 2 (Systems).
2. Gorge combat frames: slow-frame CPU profile, then the top exact cut (Systems CPU side, Rendering GPU side).
3. Rust: remaining program binds / per-draw driver cost (Rendering).
4. Verdict pass on all 8 maps -> close M1.
If items 1-3 are done and a map still misses, Integration brings the user the numbers and the options; no open-ended
tuning loops.

## M2 - Smart AI becomes the default
Exit, all required:
- 400 matches over 4 maps: Smart >= 55 % of decided matches vs Classic.
- Same aim proven: Smart's hit % at Classic's shot mix within 1 point of Classic in every range band.
- Visible intelligence: cover >= 8 % of engaged time; settled squad distance to leader median <= 25 m;
  flanks no longer a net loss on any map.
- Classic identity IDENTICAL; DETERMINISM; BOTTEST cost; stuck rate <= Classic.
- User playtest says yes.
Bounded work list: flank route budget, squad regroup fix, shot-mix check; then the 400 rerun.
If the 400 misses after these, Integration brings the user the numbers before more tuning.

## M3 - Playtest delivery
Exit: build/release (the user's exe) and the slim package rebuilt from the closed M1 (+ M2 if closed) head,
package isolation check passes (0 errors on 3 maps, all English lines play), user has it.

## M4 - Optional HD texture pack (faithful)
Exit: full RealPLKSR pass (colour + normals) + DAT2 pass (character / weapon) done, loader verified in game,
before / after sheet to the user, remake list frozen. The remake pass is a separate milestone (M4b) after the
user's verdict.

## Later (start after M1 closes, in this order unless the user re-ranks)
- M5 Upscaling + frame generation (D3D12 interop -> FSR 3 / DLSS / FG), optional, off by default.
- M6 Modern materials mode (optional).
- M7 Ray tracing (shadows + AO -> reflections -> GI), optional, off by default.
