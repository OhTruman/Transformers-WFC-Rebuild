# WFC Rebuild — Playable Vertical Slice Status

_Updated as work proceeds. Build: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build.ps1`
→ `build/bin/wfc_rebuild.exe`. Fidelity audit + provenance: `FIDELITY.md`._

## SYSTEMS PASS 1 (2026-10-01) — WEAPON LAYERING, RECOIL, ANIMATED WEAPON, ORIGINAL FX + SOUNDCUES
Systems-agent branch `agents/systems`. All values recovered from cooked data (details and
confidence in FIDELITY.md PASS 7; decoders in `tools/systems/`).
- **Reload on the move**: reload plays in the original `UpperBodyCustom` slot masked from
  `C_Spine01_Lumbar01_XB` (AnimNodeBlendMultiBone), blend 0.1/0.1 s; the legs keep the strafe/jog
  clip (no more glide). Verified: base `Nav_StrafeJog_F` at 5.5 m/s + upper `Shooting_Reload_IonBlaster_ROBO`.
- **Recoil**: HmSkelControlRecoil port on SpineRecoil / RightHandRecoil with the Ion Blaster's
  authored RecoilDefs (restart per shot, decaying sinusoid in aim space).
- **Animated weapon**: the Ion Blaster is its 34-joint skeletal mesh playing its own
  Fire / Reload_AP / Idle anims with authored sockets; the muzzle is the MuzzleFlash socket.
- **Event timing**: weapon AnimNotifies drive reload/idle sounds at the authored times.
- **FX**: muzzle flash, tracer bolt + smoke trail, impact squib rebuilt from the cooked
  ParticleSystems (original textures, blend modes, bursts, lifetimes, sizes, velocities,
  colour/alpha/size curves, squib rules). Replaces the yellow line + box placeholder.
- **Audio**: original SoundCues: layered fire (near/mid/distant by distance), low-ammo, tail,
  impact, reload, idle; dB/semitone variation, timed events, concurrency, FMOD inverse rolloff.
- Diagnostics: `WFC_ANIMLOG` (base/upper/recoil/weapon clip), `WFC_NOTIFYLOG`, `WFC_CUELOG`.
- **Not done / handed off:** camera recoil + shake (camera owned by Gameplay), dry-fire trigger,
  upper-body aim offset, shell/magazine/reload FX rendering, mixer/reverb. The idle base clip
  `Cust_Idle` (showcase idle) should be `NAV_Idle`; that is Gameplay's locomotion selection.

## FIDELITY PASS 6 (2026-10-01) — INTERACTIVE PLAYER FIXES (orientation, locomotion, muzzle, reload, transform)
Runtime observation (replaying the exe) drove this pass, not headless smoke. Fixed, in the
player's priority order:
- **#1 Orientation/facing** — the robot now faces the **camera/aim (mouse) direction every
  frame** (`CharacterMovement`: robot `setYaw(faceYaw)` always; vehicle faces its travel dir).
  The old "only set yaw while moving" caused the body to **snap right** when you rotated the
  camera while standing then walked. Confirmed numerically: `face·toCam ≈ −0.9` (back to the
  chase cam). Mesh yaw offset is **0** (the earlier "90° bug" was a `WFC_FIXYAW` diagnostic
  artifact — the diagnostic set camYaw *after* faceYaw was latched; fixed its ordering too).
  WASD = move direction, mouse/camera = facing — the WFC strafe-shooter control model.
- **#2 Locomotion** — directional strafe clips: pick `Nav_Strafe{Jog,Walk}_{F/B/L/R}` by the
  travel direction **relative to facing** (dot of velocity with facing fwd/right), replacing the
  hardcoded `_F`. Verified: strafe-right → `Nav_StrafeJog_R`, forward → `_F`.
  (Upper-body aim-offset `Shooting_Aim_*` grid + start/stop/turn-in-place still PROVISIONAL.)
- **#3 Transformation** — robot and vehicle each carry a transform clip of **matching duration**
  (ToVehicle 1.97 s, ToRobot 1.13 s): one physical fold authored per mesh. Was played
  **sequentially** (robot fully → hard cut at full-fold mismatch → vehicle fully = the "crack",
  ~3.1 s). Now the outgoing mesh plays to the **midpoint**, then hands off to the partner mesh's
  clip **resumed at the same normalized time** — one continuous fold (verified frames 35→69→135:
  robot folds → matched mid-fold → clean vehicle). Weapon holstered for the whole transform.
  (Cross-mesh pop is minimised, not eliminated — true alpha cross-fade/visibility point is PROV.)
- **#4 Muzzle** — tracer + flash now originate at the **barrel tip** (weapon-local gltf
  (2.063, 0.017, 0.141), the frontmost vertex slice of `weapon.glb`), transformed by the weapon
  world matrix — **2.07 m forward** of the hand attach, so shots leave the gun, not the fist.
- **#5 Reload** — `Shooting_Reload_IonBlaster_ROBO` now plays (full-body, one-shot) while the
  weapon's reload timer runs. Verified pose + `reloading=1`. (WFC's additive `ADD_Shooting_
  Reload_*` upper-body overlay, to reload on the move, needs additive blending — PARTIAL.)
- Diagnostics added (env-gated): `WFC_AUTOSTRAFE/AUTOBACK`, `WFC_AUTORELOAD`, `WFC_FACELOG`,
  `WFC_MUZZLELOG`; frame log now prints `reloading`.
- **Still open:** #6/#7/#8 lighting cohesion (only coeff0 of 3 directional coeffs used; character
  lighting; materials), #10 camera tuning, and a magenta-material prop near spawn (nolightmap view).

## FIDELITY PASS 5 (2026-10-01) — BAKED LIGHTMAPS RECOVERED, DECODED, AND RENDERED
**Streets is now lit by its original authored baked lightmaps.** The licensee-144 lightmap
serialization was cracked: directional lightmap (3 coeff textures), texture = BE export index
into the ART export table (seekfree forward-export → `_LM` atlas), then CoordinateScale/Bias.
- `vs_lightmap.py` decodes all **1793 lightmapped components** → **1755/1952 props** mapped
  (atlas + CoordinateScale/Bias + HDR ScaleVector), 20 atlases (PNG via umodel, 1024² DXT1).
- `vs_map.py` emits TEXCOORD_1 + lightmap node extras → `world.glb`; renderer draws lightmapped
  submeshes unlit × atlas (UV1·scale+bias via texture matrix) × HDR ScaleVector (GL_COMBINE 4×).
  **1962 submeshes lit.** A/B: `WFC_NOLIGHTMAP=1`.
- Verified across spawn 0 / region 6 / region 18: per-region baked shadows + coloured bounce
  (purple/green/warm), bright lit doorways, high contrast — authentically WFC; no artefacts.
- Regression: collision 1.85 M tris, vehicle hover, robot, emissive glow all intact; exit 0.
- **Pipeline order:** vs_lightmap → vs_map → vs_collision (vs_map resets collision.glb).

## FIDELITY PASS 4 (2026-10-01) — lightmap atlases recovered; emissive glow applied
- **Lightmap ATLASES RECOVERED:** umodel decodes the 360-tiled `MP_IAC_Streets_ART_m_LM.xxx` →
  **78 LightMapTexture2D** (1024² PF_DXT1 RGB), preserved in `…/MP_IAC_Streets/lightmaps/`.
  Confirmed real baked lighting. **Component→atlas binding still BLOCKED** (seekfree GUID
  resolution; no instance imports; mixed-endian native block). Exact layout + blocker in
  FIDELITY.md. **No guessed lightmap mapping applied.**
- **EMISSIVE GLOW APPLIED:** Optimus's authored `*_emissive.png` glow masks are loaded and
  drawn as an additive self-illumination pass — blue glowing eyes/energon/Autobot vents (iconic
  WFC look), from original data. Robot/vehicle/weapon. Verified via screenshots.
- **Regression:** vehicle hover (Y −722.5 = ground+2 m) + cruise ~15 m/s + collision (1.85 M
  tris) + robot all intact after the renderer change; clean build, exit 0.

## FIDELITY PASS 3 (2026-10-01) — vehicle physics recovered; lightmaps investigated
- **Optimus VEHICLE PHYSICS RECOVERED** from `Default__TnHoverCarSimulationBlueprint`
  (TransGame.xxx) — WFC vehicles **hover**. Applied: max speed **15 m/s** (MaxLinearSpeed 1500),
  accel **30 m/s²** (3000), dash/boost **50 m/s** (DashSpeed 5000, 0.3 s burst), hover height
  **2 m** (SuspensionRadius 200), jump **12 m/s** (1200), turn ~π rad/s, terminal 80 m/s.
  Verified: vehicle floats 2 m above the street, cruises ~13.6→15 m/s. Boost on Sprint.
  (The Form CDOs only held `=1.0` modifiers; base values live on the *Simulation* blueprints.)
- **Baked lightmaps — investigated deeply, BLOCKED.** 78 LightMapTexture2D atlases exist;
  umodel can decode the 360 textures; meshes already carry TEXCOORD_1. Blocker: the per-
  component lightmap binding is native-serialized (licensee 144) with **GUID-based** texture
  refs (0 imports) and unresolved scale/bias float offsets. Precise findings in FIDELITY.md.
- **Robot movement sanity:** jump re-measured 6.41 m (analytically 6.25; no regression);
  GroundSpeed/accel/air/jump/capsule all intact.

## FIDELITY PASS 2 (2026-10-01) — recover from the executable + extend extraction
Ghidra/ReVa is live with `default.xex`; pawn/vehicle CDOs read from cooked packages
(`Game Dump/TransGame/CookedXenon/{TransGame,Engine}.xxx`) via `ue3pkg`+`props`.
- **Street collision RECOVERED.** props.json already carries authored block flags: **1693 of
  1952 props block**, 259 decorative don't. New `AssetTools/scripts/wfc/vs_collision.py`
  regenerates `collision.glb` = BSP + blocking volumes + **1693 blocking props** (instanced,
  5.46 MB → 1.85 M world tris). Player now stands on the street floor and is blocked by real
  building walls (previously walked through). Verified across 4 spawns (~180×164 m).
- **Robot movement RECOVERED** from `Default__TnPlayerPawn`/`Default__TnPawn`:
  GroundSpeed 5.5 m/s, AccelRate 20.48 m/s², AirControl 0.70, AirSpeed 15 m/s — all applied.
- **Jump/collision RECOVERED:** MaxJumpHeight 6.25 m (JumpZ derived 19.17 m/s; **measured
  6.39 m**), capsule radius 1.75 m / half-height 2.0 m (4 m tall), eye height 2.8 m.
- **Weapon socket rotation RECOVERED** (rotator yaw 172°/roll 30° → gltf matrix); applied.
- **Vehicle base physics**: still in a data asset (not parsed) — provisional.
- **Camera distance**: orbit-list driven (data asset not extracted) — provisional (9 m).
- **HeightFog RECOVERED**: LightColor (234,91,116) warm red-pink, Density 2e-5/UU, StartDistance
  2048 UU (from `MP_IAC_Streets_ART_m HeightFogComponent`) — applied (was guessed blue-grey).
- **Lightmaps**: 78 LightMapTexture2D in `MP_IAC_Streets_ART_m_LM.xxx`; per-component binding is
  native-serialized + 360-tiled textures — path documented in FIDELITY.md, #1 remaining visual gap.
- Fidelity table + provenance: `FIDELITY.md`.

## FIDELITY PASS 1 (2026-10-01) — recover original WFC behaviour from authored data
Evidence root: cooked UE3 config `ExtractedAssets/config/Coalesced_ini/.../Cooked/*.ini`,
map metadata `ExtractedAssets/maps/*.json`, asset metadata `VerticalSlice/**/*.json`.
- **Gravity [CONF]** −29.4 m/s² (WorldInfo.DefaultGravityZ −2940); vehicles −19.4 (RB ×0.66).
- **Transformation [CONF+fix]** now **crossfades** (blend-in 0.115 s / blend-out 0.25 s from
  TnTransformation); was a hard cut at every clip boundary → the jaggedness. Cross-skeleton
  mesh handoff is still an inherent cut.
- **Camera FOV [CONF]** 75° horizontal (Xe-TransCamera TnFovCameraBehavior), converted to
  vertical by aspect; was a guessed 70° vertical.
- **Ion Blaster [CONF]** damage 15, interval 0.065, mag 50, reserve max 250 confirmed;
  **fixed** initial reserve 150, reload 1.5 s, range 300 m + 1.0→0.5× falloff, per-shot spread.
- **Lighting/materials [fix, PROV]** washed-out cause = ambient floored brightness at ~0.70;
  lowered ambient + warm key + specular + exp2 fog. (Baked lightmaps not extracted.)
- **Audio [fix, PROV]** master 0.5 + 3D attenuation/pan (`playAt`/`setListener`); was full-
  volume mono.
- **Map [investigated]** Streets composed from all 3 sublevels (BSP + 1952 props). Gaps:
  static-mesh collision not extracted (confines walkable area), 16 PrefabInstances + HeightFog
  not composed, lightmaps not extracted. See FIDELITY.md.

## DONE (verified via screenshots / logs)
- **P1 Scale / placement / camera.** World is authored in **metres** (no global scale
  applied). Optimus ≈ 4.4 m. Huge ±4800 bounds were the **skydome**, not a unit mismatch.
  Player spawns at the authored FFA start (363.5, −723.6, −341.8), ground-snapped onto the
  collision surface, facing the play-area centroid. Third-person follow camera
  (dist 9 m, height 3.2 m, mouse look, near 0.1 / far 20000). **Framing bug fixed:** a
  leftover `cam.y < 0.5 → 0.5` clamp was launching the camera ~720 m into the sky at the
  map's negative Y; removed. Optimus is now clearly framed on the Streets.
- **P2 Collision.** Flat-ground hack removed. Loads `collision.glb` (3,495 tris) into a
  uniform XZ grid (2 m cells). Downward ground raycast + grounding + gravity; horizontal
  wall blocking via segment tests; respawn when falling below kill-Z. Auto-walk test: player
  walks across real geometry staying grounded at Y≈−724.5.
- **P3 Skeletal animation.** Full glTF skin path: 106-joint skeleton, inverse-bind
  matrices, JOINTS_0/WEIGHTS_0, animation samplers/channels (T/R/S), LINEAR/STEP/CUBICSPLINE
  interpolation, quaternion slerp, hierarchical node transforms, **CPU skinning** each step
  into a dynamic mesh. State machine (ROBOT: idle/walk/run/jump/fall; VEHICLE:
  idle/move) keyed off the **authoritative `extras.category`** strings in the GLBs.
  Additive (`ADD_`) clips are skipped for base poses. Debug log: form / anim name / anim time.
- **P4 Transformation.** ROBOT↔VEHICLE via the paired transform clips
  (`transform_to_vehicle` → handoff → `vehicle_transform_to_vehicle`, and the reverse).
  **Separate skeletons, no interpolation** between them; skeleton/mesh handoff at the end of
  the outgoing clip; input locked for the whole transition; settles into the new form's idle.
  Verified: ROBOT → Transform_ToVehicle_ROBO → VEHICLE → …_Veh → Nav_Hover_Pose_VEH.

- **P5 Materials / textures.** glTF materials parsed (baseColorTexture + baseColorFactor);
  meshes split into per-material submeshes with UVs on both the static baker (map) and the
  skinned loader (characters). PNGs decoded via a platform adapter (GDI+) behind
  `platform::decodeImage` → `render::ImageData` → `IRenderer::uploadTexture` (GL texture),
  cached by URI. Fixed-function GL modulates the texture by the directional+ambient light.
  Verified: Optimus red/blue paint + back wheel; Streets wear their rust/metal textures.
  24 textures loaded, 0 failed. (Normal/emissive/specular deferred — not straightforward in
  GL 1.1 fixed-function.)

- **P6 Ion Blaster.** `weapon.glb` loaded + textured, held at `WeaponSocket_Primary`
  (bone `R_Arm03_Elbow_XB`, node 42) — the weapon follows the bone's world transform each
  frame (robot form only). Hitscan while trigger held: 15 dmg, 0.065 s interval, 50-round
  mag, 250 reserve, auto-reload on empty + manual reload (R), ~1.8 s. Ray vs collision mesh +
  vs damageable targets (AABB). Yellow tracer (muzzle→impact) + muzzle-flash box. A practice
  **DamageTarget** dummy spawns ahead of the player. Verified: weapon in hands, tracer fires,
  ammo 50→25 under auto-fire.
- **P7 Audio.** `audio::IAudio` abstraction + Win32 `waveOut` polling mixer (decodes PCM WAV,
  nearest-resamples to 48 kHz stereo, mixes overlapping one-shot voices; silent no-op if no
  device). Cues loaded & wired by gameplay event (edge-detected in `World::tick`): fire
  (Ion Blaster), reload (gun foley), transform (gears), land (thump). Gameplay never touches
  Windows audio directly. Footsteps deferred (no clear footstep asset located).
- **P8 Dev tools.** Screenshot capture (kept). Runtime debug overlay toggle (B / env
  `WFC_DEBUGDRAW`): world/collision bounds, player capsule, aim ray, weapon-socket marker.
  Window-title HUD now shows FPS, position, speed, form, grounded/airborne, current anim +
  time, HP, ammo/reserve, reload + DBG state. STATUS.md maintained; headless verification
  knobs documented below.

## CURRENT
- P1–P8 complete and screenshot-verified. Polish candidates below.

## NEXT (polish, optional)
- Weapon socket rotation (currently translation-only offset; orientation is approximate).
- Walk clip picks a strafe-jog; prefer a forward locomotion clip by name.
- Normal/emissive/specular maps (needs a programmable path; GL 1.1 fixed-function can't).
- Footstep audio; smoother transform-handoff frame (config-driven fraction < 1.0).

## BLOCKERS
- None. (Headless smoke runs ~real-time, so long clips need proportionally more
  `WFC_SMOKE_FRAMES`; not a product blocker.)

## CONTROLS
- WASD move, mouse look, Space jump, LMB fire (hold = auto), R reload, F transform,
  C free/capture cursor, B debug overlay, Esc quit.

## ASSET PATHS (root = `F:/Transformers Rebuild/ExtractedAssets/VerticalSlice`, override `WFC_ASSETS`)
- Map:        `Maps/MP_IAC_Streets/world.glb`, `collision.glb`, `spawnpoints.json`
- Optimus:    `Characters/Optimus/robot.glb` (skin+75 clips), `vehicle.glb` (skin+13 clips),
              `character.json`
- (P6) Weapon: `Weapons/IonBlaster/…`

## DEV / TEST ENV VARS
- `WFC_SMOKE_FRAMES=N`  headless; run N frames then exit.
- `WFC_SHOT=path.bmp`   capture a screenshot on the final smoke frame.
- `WFC_DEBUGCAM=front|top`  diagnostic camera + a bright beacon on the player.
- `WFC_AUTOWALK=1`      hold Forward (scripted locomotion test).
- `WFC_AUTOFIRE=1`      hold the trigger (scripted weapon test).
- `WFC_AUTOTRANSFORM=F` trigger a transform at frame F.
- `WFC_DEBUGDRAW=1`     enable the debug overlay from start (same as toggling B).
- `WFC_ASSETS=dir`      override the asset root.
- `WFC_ANIMLOG=1` / `WFC_NOTIFYLOG=1` / `WFC_CUELOG=1`  weapon layering / AnimNotify / SoundCue logs.
